# About Our Dataset

Our dataset was retrieved from Kaggle. The target of the dataset was types of diabetes or prediabetic conditions. The data provides an overview of these various types of diabetes and a range of attributes such as medical, genetic, and lifestyle factors. We selected to focus on 5 types of diabetes and how they related to the attributes that help us answer our questions.

#Questions

1 - Is there a correlation between cholesterol and blood glucose levels and the different types of diabetes?

2 - What is the dispersal of Diabetes patients that partake in different lifestyle choices like drinking alcohol and smoking among these five types of Diabetes? Does whether or not someone has a family history of diabetes seem to make a difference in these lifestyle choices?

3 - How the average BMI and BP varies across different types of diabetes?

4 - Pregnancy - How do factors (history of complications and weight gain) relate to diabetes?

The data shows that no one diabetes type accounts for a significantly higher share of the total complications, but when looking at average weight gain during pregnancy Type 2 Diabetes has the highest average, with Type 3c and Gestational Diabetes also falling above the mean
